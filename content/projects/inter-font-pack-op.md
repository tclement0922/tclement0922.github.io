#### [GitHub repo](https://github.com/tclement0922/inter-font-pack-op)

A Magisk module that replaces OnePlus's system fonts with Inter and other complementary fonts. Forked from [kdrad0n's inter-font-pack project](https://github.com/kdrag0n/inter-font-pack).

### Why this fork?

Initially, I had installed the original module by kdrag0n, then I realized that the font was not applied everywhere, like on the quick settings clock or on the home screen widget. I looked inside some system apks and found that most of the OnePlus apps had the OnePlus sans embedded in their resources, so I decided to create this fork to fix these issues. Also, I didn't make a pull request because of the size of the module (44.3 MB for this fork against 5.19 MB for the original module).
